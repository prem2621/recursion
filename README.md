# 🔁 Recursion Practice – Step into the World of Self Calls

This repository contains my **personal practice journey** with Recursion — one of the most important (and toughest) concepts in programming.  
I've used this space to collect problems, patterns, and solutions in **JavaScript** (or your preferred language) while learning from top educators.

## 📖 What is Recursion?

Recursion is a method where a function **calls itself** to solve smaller instances of the same problem — until it hits a base condition.  
It’s often used in:

- Tree and graph problems 🌳
- Backtracking algorithms ♻️
- Divide and conquer strategies ⚔️
- Dynamic programming optimization 💡

## 🧠 Why Recursion is Hard (But Not Impossible)

> “Recursion is hard to understand at first — but it’s not impossible.”

Like many freshers, I too struggled with recursion initially. The idea of functions calling themselves, base cases, stack overflow, etc., all sounded scary.  
But everything changed when I started learning from:

- 🧠 [Take U Forward (Striver)](https://www.youtube.com/@takeUforward)  
- 🎓 [Kunal Kushwaha](https://www.youtube.com/@kunalkushwaha)

> *"If you want to learn recursion, I strongly recommend watching Take U Forward and Kunal Kushwaha. They made it finally make sense to me!"* – **Prem Kumar**
