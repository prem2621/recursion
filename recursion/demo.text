ðŸ“Œ 1. Basic Recursion (Understanding the Concept)
These are fundamental problems to build your recursive thinking.

âœ… Print numbers using recursion

Print numbers from 1 to N

Print numbers from N to 1

âœ… Sum of first N numbers
âœ… Factorial of N
âœ… Nth Fibonacci number
âœ… Power of a number (X^N)
âœ… Reverse an array using recursion
âœ… Check if a string is palindrome







ðŸ“Œ 2. Intermediate Recursion Problems
These problems are slightly more complex but still focus on recursion.

âœ… Find GCD (Greatest Common Divisor) using recursion
âœ… Count digits in a number using recursion
âœ… Reverse a number using recursion
âœ… Tower of Hanoi
âœ… Subset sum problem
âœ… Check if an array is sorted
âœ… Binary Search using recursion
âœ… Merge Sort using recursion
âœ… Quick Sort using recursion



ðŸ“Œ 3. Backtracking (Advanced Recursion Technique)
Backtracking is used when you need to explore multiple options.

âœ… Generate all subsets of an array
âœ… Generate all subsequences of a string
âœ… Generate all permutations of a string/array
âœ… N-Queens Problem
âœ… Sudoku Solver
âœ… Rat in a Maze Problem
âœ… Word Search (Find a word in a 2D grid)
âœ… Knight's Tour Problem





ðŸ“Œ 4. Recursion on Subsequences
These problems help understand how to generate subsequences and subsets.

âœ… Print all subsequences of an array
âœ… Count the number of subsequences with sum K
âœ… Find all subsets of a given set
âœ… Find all subsets of an array that sum to a given value
âœ… Partition array into two subsets with equal sum





ðŸ“Œ 5. Recursion on Permutations
Here, youâ€™ll generate different permutations of arrays/strings.

âœ… Generate all permutations of a string/array
âœ… Find all unique permutations (avoid duplicates)
âœ… Lexicographically next greater permutation
âœ… K-th permutation sequence
âœ… Generate all valid parentheses combinations





ðŸ“Œ 6. Miscellaneous Recursion Problems
These are real-world recursion-based problems.

âœ… Josephus Problem (Find the survivor in a circular elimination game)
âœ… Print all paths from top-left to bottom-right in a grid
âœ… Find all palindromic partitions of a string
âœ… Word Break Problem
âœ… Generate Gray Code sequences
